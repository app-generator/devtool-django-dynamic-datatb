## How It Works

The `Dynamic DataTables` tool aims to enable a powerful data table interface on top of any Django codebase with a minimum effort. Here are the steps:

- `Define a new model` in the project (an old one can be also used)
- `Execute the database migration` to create/update the associated tables
- `Update the configuration` to enable the Dynamic Data Table service over the model
- `Start` the app
- Access the `Dynamic DataTable` provided on op of the model

For instance, if the new model managed by the Dynamic DatTable Service is called `books`, the associate API is exposed at `/datatb/books/`

<br />

| Status | Item | info | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| âœ… | New Models Definition in `apps/models` | - |
| âœ… | The app is saved in `apps/dyn_datatables` | - |
| âœ… | Models enabled in `core/settings.py` via `DYNAMIC_DATATB` variable | - |
| âœ… | The project exposes automaticaly a view powered by `Simple-DataTables` JS Library | - |
| âœ… | Path of the service: `/datatb/products/` | In case the new model is `Products` | - | 
| âœ… | The page exposes the controls: `Items per page`, `Search`, `Server Side Pagination`  | - |
